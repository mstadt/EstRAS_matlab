# Estrogen-RAS model (MATLAB)
This code is for the May 2025 University of Waterloo Applied Mathematics Hackathon project. This code runs the estrogen-RAS model as presented in [Stadt and Layton, "A physiology-based mathematical model of the renin-angiotensin system, bone remodeling, and calcium homeostasis: Effects of estrogen and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors", submitted](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.01.651663v2.abstract)

## Key files
**driver_SS.m** Run this file to compute the steady state of the model using the function fsolve

**driver_ESTdecline.m** Run this file to conduct simulations of the RAS during age-related estrogen decline with and without RASi
